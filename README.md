# Predicting Car Insurance Claims Using Machine Learning 
Statement of the Problem: The increasing complexity of car insurance risk assessment 
requires advanced predictive models to minimize losses and improve policyholder services. 
Insurance companies need to accurately predict the likelihood of a claim being filed within the 
next six months to optimize policy pricing and risk mitigation strategies. This project aims to 
develop a model of machine learning to predict claim probability based on policyholder and 
vehicle attributes, improving risk assessment and decision-making. 

Tools and Technology: 
- Programming & Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random 
Forest) 
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn 
- Data Storage & Processing: SQL, CSV files 
- Data Gathering: The dataset for this project is obtained from Kaggle, containing detailed 
information about policyholders, vehicle specifications, and claim history. It includes structured 
data with categorical and numerical attributes essential for model training. 

Dataset Specifications: 
- Total Records: 97,655 
- Total Variables: 44 

Policyholder Information: policy_tenure, age_of_policyholder, area_cluster, 
population_density 

Vehicle Attributes: age_of_car, make, segment, fuel_type, engine_type, airbags, 
transmission_type, ncap_rating 

Safety Features: is_esc, is_tpms, is_parking_sensors, is_brake_assist, is_power_steering 

Target Variable: is_claim (Binary - 0: No claim, 1: Claim)
